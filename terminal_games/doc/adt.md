# Python ADTs

ADT stands for [Abstruct Data Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type).

Python's basic ADTs are: List, Tuple, Set & Dictionary

## List

Python's `list` is an **ordered** collection of elements.
Each element has a numerical index that indicates it's *poitional* placment.
That is, for the following list: `a = ['12', '13', '14']`, the first element is `'12'`, and it can be accessed by it's *positional* index: `a[0]`.
On the other hand, the last element is `'14'` (index 2) and can be accessed by either an index from the beginning (`a[2]`) or from the end (`a[-1]`).
